Well that doesn't resemble an ecb encrypted image, but we are pure hearted and innocent so we decide to believe in the challenge name and description and start playing around with the images in GIMP and Stegosolve.

After some time we start seing something:

<img src="{{ site-url }}/assets/backdoorctf17/ecb-4.png">

<img src="{{ site-url }}/assets/backdoorctf17/ecb-5.jpg">
<img src="{{ site-url }}/assets/backdoorctf17/ecb-6.png">

Overlapping the images and tracing over the lines we can more or less read the flag.
