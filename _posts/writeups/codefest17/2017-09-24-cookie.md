This is the page we see when we access the service:

![alt text]({{ site-url }}/assets/codefest17/cookie-1.png)

Going through the page cookies, I found this:

![alt text]({{ site-url }}/assets/codefest17/cookie-2.png)

I tried to set the *flag* cookie to *False* and send the form.
As a result, the old form is replaced by the following:

<img src="{{ site-url }}/assets/codefest17/cookie-3.png" width="550" >

After several tries, I found out that the correct username was *root*.

I sent the form again:

<img src="{{ site-url }}/assets/codefest17/cookie-6.png" width="550" >


In the list of cookies, I now see this:

<img src="{{ site-url }}/assets/codefest17/cookie-4.png">

The values of the *pass* cookie is an md5 hash for the word *aunty*.
I type it as a password, and I find out it's the flag:
